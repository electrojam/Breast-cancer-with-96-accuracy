# Breast-Cancer-Diagnosis---KFold-RF-with-96.42-accuracy
Welcome to my first kernel on Kaggle. In this notebook, I explore the Breast Cancer dataset and develop an RF model to try classifying suspected cells as Benign or Malignant.  after using K-fold cross-validation with logistic regression, RF, SVM, and KNN to check the best model for my dataset.
